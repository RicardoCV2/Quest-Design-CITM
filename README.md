## Introduction

It does not matter if they are small or large characteristics of a videogame, the missions have to have a development behind that helps both the player and the game itself, they are a factor that helps the feeling of immersion and of affiliation to the game that depends on creating a link with the player. A large majority of games tend to have a very bad approach in terms of Quest Design as they do not emphasize creating a game aimed for Quest Design and simply give it less relevance at the time of creation, this can tend to create a game and a totally flat product since it does not obtain factors of evolution. Companies that invest a lot of time and relevance in the questing aspect unlike the others, end up obtaining a great benefit and success by this aspect (e.g., The Witcher 3).
 During the article, three points will be the pinnacles for the research and the better understanding of what quests mean for a videogame and how much importance they have.
 * What they **are**
 * What they **must be like**
 * What do they **convey**
 
 # Quest - Main Quest - Side Quest
 
### Definition

“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.” [Jeszek Szczepanski - Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn (GDC 2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykPZcG8_mPU&feature=youtu.be)

The basic definition would be a task for a player or a group of players that may be completed to obtain a rewarding after succesfully completing it.

From this point we can focus on any action that the player makes can be converted into a quest, we simply have to award him a prize after completing that action. This factor is very short of explanation because within the action of the player we can find and have to be able to differentiate between a main quest and a side quest.

### Main Quest & Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main QUest is simply an action that you must complete to advance the game, and instead a Side Quest is a mission that the game or you decide whether to fulfill or not, no important effect on the core of the game. The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the history of a game is divided into different mission chains, and you choose the "A" option, this does not imply a set of missions that you had to complete to advance through the history of the game if you had decided otherwise. Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that “skippable” anymore.

### Main Quests 

According to Dean Razavi, Razbury Games Game Designer. a main quest is a big change in the plot of the narrative arc that create a new path for the player making it a inflexion point, meaning this that anything that is not related to the main plot of the story of the game is directly not considered a main quest.

 ### Side Quests
 
 The Side Quests help you understand and describe better and more deeply, the world that involves the main character as it explains and makes you discover a more in depth view of the main narrative arc of the game, all this while explaining secondary stories and discovering more things about its inhabitants and its lore.

## Main Pillars

The prerequisites that a Quest must have are:

* **Meaningful**, the player needs a direct connection with the game, needs to be engaged with it completely. Time will be spent and invested on the game and whether it is a 2 minutes or a three hours quest. We can't disappoint them letting them down by making the player into a situation where you are forced to do something that they are not enjoying just to get a better reward that will have better content later on the game.

* **Convey**, Mainly it has to express itself, it has to convey feelings and sensations,to make the previously mentioned connection a more easily accessible path, while narrating the facts that made that one village be what it is today, or explain what happened between these kids fighting over who gets to do something first.

* **Immersive & interactive**, the player has a dircet connection with the game, joining and taking part directly on it, he/she is not reading or watching a story be told, they are participating on it. They must feel important while playing, the game must create a sensation of immersion on the story making them feel like it changes the curse of the plot depending on the decisions and actions they made. If the player has no sensation of being part of the quest's narration, they won't relate to the characters and of course to the story, and we'll have failed them on its design.

## Quest Categories

We can classify the quests on 4 different types:

**Gather Quest**: "Go to the nearest forest and bring me 10 types of mushrooms."

**Escort Quest**: "Protect me and my father!", basically a protect an NPC on its way to another location.

**Delivery Quest**"Can you bring this to my sick mother next town warrior?", bring something from a NPC to another one to obtain something (normally the object you brought).

**Kill Quest**"Kill 5 Big Fang Wolves",classic killing quest.

# Quest Creation
## Concept

First of all you have to look at your own game from the outside, what kind of game we have, what kind of resources we have, can we do everything we want to do? Depending on the type of game that will be played, one type of resource or another will be used, you can use a larger system or a more closed system, you can create puzzles or mini-games,maybe only use killing quests.

If you have a narrow system the team can afford to work easier and co-ordinated, the game will also be affected since it will be much more repetitive and consequently, boring.
On the other hand if the team can afford a larger and wider system it allows you to freely do anything you want, the process will be more tedious and more extensive but quests will be interesting and most likely fun to play. 
The most efficient one is to be in the middle, so that your quest system is dynamic enough to be fast and have all the team members on the same page and allow for design freedom and interesting quest concepts at the same time. All the team has to agree while creating the quests system . programmers and artists don't seem a vital decision making but they will be the ones that create the system and the art, so they have to know what they can afford and what they don't.

Once the decisions have been done and the team knows what way they're heading its time to start the quest concepts. Brainstorming and writting all the ideas down is the best way to do it, then the team will filter them and choose. Try to avoid the first ones as they are the ones that create the most the "cliche" effect. Write, in a couple short sentences, what the concept of the quest would be, followed by what the player should do in order to complete it in a really general way.
The concept tends to be simple but the main ideas are already clear and express a concise idea,that indicates that the quest has potential

## Repetitive type

When a base for the quests has already been established, you can start to think what kind of quests you will create, and in what kind of situations they will be used. The kill quests will be used to teach the player how to fight and to teach the main mechanics. If they are not used carefully the game can become long and repetitive. The same applies for fetch quests and delivery quests. Always think about the type of content that you would like as a player and what you would like to happen, avoid always repeat the quests a lot.

## Main Quests important features

Always remember when creating and designing the main quests that the story is the main factor. The Main Quests explain and express how the player evolves throughout the story, and how that factor affects the entire course of the narrative arc.

Never use main factors of the plot as enemies to create a Main quest, use the main character or the group to do it. Analyze what kind of situations you will have to create for the hero to go to that place to defeat the monster and get an improvement, from there, try to relate the villain to link the story to the main quests, draw the story to those Points of Interest, in a way that feels natural. This is why the villain is a powerful tool, and its proper use will tend to result in a stronger narrative.

If you want to directly link the quest, without it modifying the development of the story, create different paths to join in the Point of Interest.To make the player percieve their decision as meaningful, you can use further references to their choice of path later in the story, and even modify the ending of your game based on their choices, the player will feel a lot more into the game if he is the one that creates the ending of the story, giving the chance to replay the whole game and take different options and different quests. With that, we can avoid making incredibly complex story developement options, with mutliple and completely different branches, which can take a lot of time and resources we may or may not dispose of.

## Side Quest important features

The most important facotr of the side quests are the rewards they give to the player, a non obligatory quest that provides with items or knowledge that does not affect the main plot of the game, you have to **be clear and concise with the rewards**. The player must always know what they are getting as a reward for that quest as it has an effort-payoff and maybe the reward does not correspond to the level difficulty or the rewards are just not worth the effort.
If the rewards are not specified you create an agreement with the player, if the rewards are the expected the player will be satisfied a lot, but if the rewards do not match the complexity of the level, not only they won’t have been provided with proper content, but they won’t have recieved an adequate reward to “compensate” for it either and they will feel extremely disappointed and betrayed.

**Side quests creators**, not only NPC will give you the side quests, a note on a tree, a mark on the wall that provides with a message under a rock, be aware to create a side quest that is not given to the player by a NPC, maybe curiosity can bring the player to a hidden mysterious scenario with side quests.

**Players don't only acept quests they're interested in**, we humans tend to give things a higher value when we owe them rather than  when we are obtaining it. After being presented with a mission, our brain will associate it with ownership, and we will be hesitant towards not accepting it, as this happens most of the time, create your side quests with appealing and interesting aspects to engage the player to participate on them.

**Confronting quests with conflicts on it**, try to create side quests that involve the player to think by itself either the solution, the path and the way to preceed on it, you can create a situation where the player has to decide between two different people with different problems and who to help, one will feel betrayed but alwasy add some extra effect on the reward as money or objects to make the player feel more connection with the mission. Maybe two different kids need help from the heroe to gather something or to rescue someone and one quest gives you objects and the other one gives you weapons, the player has to feel involved in the action and has to make a decision on who to betray/help.

**Create a world that simulates life and tells the story to the player**, in the RPG _Spore_ the player begins with two different options, either eat meat or eat plants, you begin as an ameba that keeps evolving, when the player gets out of the water and grows legs, you have the option of killing an entire clan or becoming its allies, if you choose to kill them some of the clans will beg for their lives at some point or will begin to escape from the player, at this point the player(not all of them), a connection with the other clans and realises that you don't have to kill them in order to obtain the improvemens they give after killing them, you can just simply become friends with them and will obtain the same result. The player now decides not to kill the other clans or to continue the massacre.Stablishing this kind of bonds between our players and the main character is the main objective we should be aiming for, since it results in an extremely pleasent experience for them.

**Timing**, always be aware of when you are creating a side quest, if you are about to kill Zeus with all the items you've gathered through the story, you've faced and killed all the gods that have stepped in your way up to the final boss, but before the final fight when you are about to get all the anger of him killing your family and manipulating you since the day you were born out of your chest,you don't want some random NPC asking you to collect some medicines for his wife.Always remember the words of the legendary professor Oak

# Pacing

Since we know what quests are, now we are going to emphasize that they transmit what we want and how we want it. One of the most powerful tools to control feelings and emotions in the player is the pacing graph. This tool is used also in Narrative design and in level design. To fully understand tshi we need to know what the tension represents and means.

## Tension

The best way to take control over the player's tension, perception and emotions is to understand it.We want the tension to affect the player but also vary throughout the story. Variations are needed in the level of increase in tension, you can not create an evolution of constant growth of tension, for this we find this tension graph that helps us understand when the viewer has time to think, to understand, to breathe and to get excited before a battle. Example of the movie Star Wars:

_Source_[image](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132423/beyond_pacing_games_arent_.php)


Humans tend to remember the moments with less tension and those who have it the most, that is why the space is left for the spectator or player to "rest". For example take _Skyrim_ as an example, you begin and the first thing you see is a carriage with people you don't know in a place you also don't know, but everything remains calmed and you feel like a new adventure is about to begin, people remember that skyrim scene because it has no tension on it.

After clearing some story and some basic mechanics and training the dragon comes in, you don't expect to suddenly fight a dragon, the scenario changes, the camera moves faster, the music is more dramatic and it creates a situation where you have to hurry up and kill the dragon with all your resources, all this while driving the player towards the climax, where they kill the dragon and end with all the tension.
